This package will define the Sanguino code necessary for Sanguino and AztEeg
programming with Arduino 1.6.6.

Directions:

In your Arduino sketchbook location, create a hardware dir. In this hardware dir
execute:

git clone https://github.com/koning/sanguino.git


The Boards menu should be populated with a new Sanguino AVR boards
section after restarting the Arduino IDE.
